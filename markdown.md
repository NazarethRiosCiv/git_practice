<!--- #### What is Markdown? ####
-->

<!--- # Markdown provides a lightweight syntax to style any text 
      # document so that it can be converted to HTML for viewing
      # publishing. Markdown translates to HTML, but it is not a
      # replacement for HTML. Markdown's syntax can be converted
      # to a small subset of HTML tags to do things like format
      # text, add links, display images, and more. To render 
      # Markdown files in HTML you'll need a Markdown parser.
-->

<!--- # Why use Markdown? Compared to HTML, writing text in 
      # Markdown is much faster because the syntax is simpler.
-->

<!--- # To write a heading for a document (<h1> level)
-->

First Level Heading
===================

<!--- # Alternatively, you could write:
-->

# First Level Heading

<!--- # To write a smaller heading (<h2> level)
-->

Second Level Heading
--------------------

<!--- # Alternatively, you could write:
-->

## Second Level Heading

My Todo List
============

At the end of this **week**, I plan to:

1. Learn Markdown
2. Write Markdown
3. Share a Markdown note

My favorite quote is:
> If you didn't get it the first time
> Do not despair
> Try and try again
> ~ Anonymous

<!--- # There are six heading tags for HTML: <h1> to <h6>
-->

# This is a H1 heading
## This is a H2 heading
### This is a H3 heading
#### This is a H4 heading
##### This is a H5 heading
###### This is a H6 heading

<!--- # In addition to numbered lists, you can style a bulleted list too.
      # There are three different symbols you can use to mark a line item
      # as a bullet: *, +, -

      # For best practice, it is recommended to use the same marker throughout,
      # your list instead of mixing them.

* Markdown
+ HTML
- XML

<!--- # The core Markdown syntax does not include nested lists, but it allows
      # adding paragraphs between list items. To do so, you need to add a blank
      # line after a list item and indent 4 spaces before starting a paragraph.
