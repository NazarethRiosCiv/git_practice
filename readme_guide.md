<!--- #### How to Write a Good README file

<!--- ### What is a README file?
      # A README file is a text file that is meant to be read
      # as soon as someone views the repository. This file 
      # contains text to introduce, explain, and share the 
      # information required to understand what the project 
      # is about. 

      # Since a README file is often the first thing a visitor
      # sees, it should tell the viewer how to install and use
      # the project.

## Conventions of a Good README File

Your README file should be as your project itself.

Make your project standout and look professional by at least including
the following elements in your README:

* **Project Title:** The name of your project
* **Description:** You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer 
questions like "why did you build this project?" and "what problem(s) does 
it solve?"
* **Features:** If your project has multiple features, list them here. 
* **How to Use:** You should write step-by-step instructions on how to install
and use your project. Any software/package requirements should be listed here.
* **Technologies:** List all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and
what purpose they serve in your project.
* **Collaborators:** If others have contributed to your project in any way, it
is important to give them credit for their work.
* **License:** It's also important to list a license on your README so other
developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project. 

Keep READMEs brief but detailed.
